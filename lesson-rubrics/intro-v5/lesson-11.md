# **Lesson 11: The DOM API – Assignment Review Guide**

## **Assignment Rubric**
You can mark the student's assignment as **complete** if they meet the following criteria:

*   **Git Workflow:** Successfully merged `lesson-10`, created a `lesson-11` branch, and submitted a new Pull Request.
*   **File Structure:** Created a `js` folder containing `index.js` and correctly linked it in `index.html` using a `<script>` tag.
*   **Dynamic Footer:** 
    *   Used `new Date().getFullYear()` (not a hardcoded string).
    *   Selected the footer, created a paragraph, and used `appendChild` to display their name and year.
*   **Skills Section:**
    *   Defined an array of strings for skills.
    *   Used a `for` loop to iterate through the array.
    *   Created `<li>` elements and appended them to the correct `<ul>`.
*   **Styling:** Used **Flexbox or Grid** in `index.css` to organize the skills list.

## **What to Look For**
*   **DOM Selection:** Are they using efficient methods like `querySelector` or `getElementById`?
*   **Loop Logic:** Is the `appendChild` call inside the loop so that every skill is added?
*   **Code Quality:** Check for clear variable names (e.g., `skillsSection`, `skill`) and proper organization.

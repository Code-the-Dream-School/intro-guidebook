# Lesson 1: JavaScript Basics and Functions

| Week | Topic                   | Learning Objective |
|------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | JS Basics and Functions | Students will be able to fork a Replit file; declare string, numerical, and boolean variables; practice with concatenating strings; and complete basic math problems.

## Assignment Rubric

Grading this first week should be pretty straightforward! You can mark the student's assignment as complete if they: 

- [ ] Have forked the Replit file and submitted their assignment. 
- [ ] `console.log` inputs properly for each of the 15 questions.
- [ ] Use proper syntax and good JavaScript logic to solve each question. [Example answers link](https://replit.com/@CarlosMoncada5/Lesson-1-JavaScript-Basics#index.js). (Note that some student variation is expected!)
- [ ] Use proper syntax and good JavaScript logic to answer the questions. Example outputs: (Note that some student work variation is expected!)

  * Q1:  `Welcome to Code the Dream!`
  * Q2:  `[Current month]`
  * Q3:  `Good Evening`
  * Q4:  `[ANY ALL-CAPITALIZED TEXT]`
  * Q5:  `I changed this` and `I started this`
  * Q6:  `10` (Can be other numbers - should be a multiplication!)
  * Q7:  `3.5` (Can be other numbers â€“ should be an average!)
  * Q8:  `console.log("Q8 neg num: ", absDiff(-6, 5)` would yield `Q8 neg num: 11`
  * Q9:  `5` (Can be other numbers - should be longest string)
  * Q10: `41` (Should display number of days until birthday)
  * Q11: `2 hours and 42 minutes` (Should display time difference)
  * Q12:  Variable student answers.

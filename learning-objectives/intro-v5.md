## Intro to Programming v5 Learning Objectives

***Note**: Intro to Programming v5 is the current version of CTD's Intro to Programming curriculum.*

| # | Lesson | Learning Objective |
|----|----|----|
|01|JS Basics and Functions|Students will develop the ability to apply foundational JavaScript concepts, including variables, data types, conditional statements, and functions, to create and troubleshoot basic programs; evaluate the use of arrow functions and traditional functions to understand their syntax, benefits, and appropriate use cases.|
|02|JS Loops and Arrays|Students will be able to construct efficient solutions to repetitive tasks by designing and implementing loops, particularly 'for' loops, while avoiding common pitfalls such as infinite loops; analyze and manipulate arrays to effectively organize and access data.|
|03|JS Objects|Students will be able to differentiate between primitive and object data types, construct and manipulate objects to amend their properties, and apply object destructuring to efficiently access and work with individual values.|
|04|JS Array Methods|Students will be able to apply array methods and iterative techniques to manipulate data, construct and utilize higher-order functions that accept or return other functions, and implement callback functions to process results sequentially; they will also use higher-order array methods such as forEach, map, and filter to efficiently iterate through arrays.

Lessons 5-11: Work in progress as we update in advance of Spring 2025. Check the v4 curriculum for an idea of what is covered. This will be completed by January 25, 2025!

## Intro to Programming v5 Learning Objectives

***Note**: Intro to Programming v5 is the current version of CTD's Intro to Programming curriculum.*

### Overall Objectives

In this course, students will:
  * **Develop and apply full-stack web development skills using modern JavaScript tools and practices.**
Students will build a solid foundation in core programming concepts, front-end development with HTML, CSS, and the DOM, asynchronous JavaScript, and version control with Git. They will integrate these skills to create interactive, responsive, and well-structured web applications.
  * **Build confidence and fluency in real-world software development workflows and problem-solving.**
Students will learn to use Git and GitHub for collaboration and version control, manage external packages with Node and NPM, and follow asynchronous programming patterns for API-driven development. Through project-based work, they will practice debugging, evaluating tradeoffs in code design, and delivering production-quality applications.

### Week-by-Week Objectives

| # | Lesson | Learning Objective |
|----|----|----|
|01|JS Basics and Functions|Students will develop the ability to apply foundational JavaScript concepts, including variables, data types, conditional statements, and functions, to create and troubleshoot basic programs; evaluate the use of arrow functions and traditional functions to understand their syntax, benefits, and appropriate use cases.|
|02|JS Loops and Arrays|Students will be able to construct efficient solutions to repetitive tasks by designing and implementing loops, particularly 'for' loops, while avoiding common pitfalls such as infinite loops; analyze and manipulate arrays to effectively organize and access data.|
|03|JS Objects|Students will be able to differentiate between primitive and object data types, construct and manipulate objects to amend their properties, and apply object destructuring to efficiently access and work with individual values.|
|04|JS Array Methods|Students will be able to apply array methods and iterative techniques to manipulate data, construct and utilize higher-order functions that accept or return other functions, and implement callback functions to process results sequentially; they will also use higher-order array methods such as forEach, map, and filter to efficiently iterate through arrays.
|05|Intro to Git|Students will be able to explain the purpose and benefits of version control systems like Git, demonstrate the ability to commit changes and navigate repository history to analyze file evolution over time, and apply GitHub to back up local work while maintaining version history. Optionally, students will design and evaluate algorithms to solve specific problems.|
|06|A Deeper Look at Git|Students will be able to apply Git commands within a visual game context to demonstrate their understanding of version control, analyze how repositories are duplicated, altered, and shared, and evaluate the impact of these actions on collaborative workflows. Optionally, students will develop and refine algorithms to enhance problem-solving strategies and write more effective code.|
|07|Understand the Web and HTML|Students will be able to explain the history and functionality of the internet and the web, analyze the structure of URLs, domain names, IP addresses, and the Domain Name System, and differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS protocols. They will demonstrate the ability to write and format HTML content, apply file paths to reference resources, and design web pages that incorporate visual content and user input forms. Additionally, students will evaluate web accessibility principles to ensure inclusivity and reach a broader audience.|
|08|CSS Basics|Students will be able to explain the purpose of CSS and compare its implementation methods (inline, internal, and external). They will apply selectors, values, and units to modify the appearance of web page elements, analyze the hierarchy of CSS rules to determine precedence, and evaluate the CSS Box Model to differentiate between margins, borders, padding, and content.|
|09|CSS Layout|Students will be able to apply advanced CSS properties to enhance the visual presentation of content, demonstrate proficiency in creating layouts using the Flexbox model, and analyze the properties and behaviors of Flexbox to build responsive designs. Optionally, students will explore the CSS Grid model as a foundation for future learning.|
|10|Responsive Design|Students will be able to apply basic design principles to format content effectively, explain the concept of Responsive Design and the mobile-first approach to accommodate diverse devices, and construct Media Queries to adapt styling based on device size. They will design flexible layouts for a portfolio site and evaluate the use of the CSS Grid model for complex content formatting needs.|
|11|The DOM API|Students will be able to explain the structure and purpose of the Document Object Model (DOM), manipulate the DOM to dynamically alter web page content, and implement event handling to respond to user interactions. They will demonstrate DOM traversal techniques to identify and interact with specific elements, and apply these skills to enhance the functionality of their portfolio site.|
|12|Asynchronous Programming and Promises|Students will be able to explain the concept of asynchronous code and its impact on user experience, define what a Promise is in JavaScript, and demonstrate the ability to create and work with Promises to manage asynchronous operations effectively.|
|13|Fetch API|Students will be able to construct and execute Fetch API requests to retrieve and send data, analyze and implement error handling strategies, and apply Async/Await syntax to manage asynchronous operations effectively.|
|14|Node NMP and Packages|Students will be able to explain the purpose and functionality of Node.js and NPM, evaluate the need for specific packages in an application, and configure a package.json file to manage dependencies and project metadata effectively.|
|15|Final Project|Students will be able to design, develop, and demonstrate a fully functional Open API project and portfolio by applying acquired technical skills, showcasing responsive design across devices, and critically reflecting on the challenges and successes of their development process.|

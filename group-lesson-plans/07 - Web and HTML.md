# Week 7: Understand the Web and HTML — Group Mentor Guide

Welcome to Week 7 of Intro to Programming!  
This week, students are learning:

- The basics of how the web works (clients, servers, requests, responses)  
- What HTML is and why it matters  
- The structure of an HTML document (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)  
- Common HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists)  
- How browsers interpret and render HTML  

## 🧊 Warm-Up (5–10 minutes)

Choose one:

**👋 Relationship-Building**  
- What’s your most-visited website and why?  
- What’s the first website you ever remember using?  

**💡 Check for Understanding (from last week)**  
- What’s one thing you learned about Git that you didn’t know before?  
- Why is it important to use version control when building websites or applications?  

## 🧭 Explore vs. Apply — Session Formats

**Explore Sessions** → Walk through how the browser, internet, and server interact. Show how a simple HTML file is structured and displayed in the browser.  

**Apply Sessions** → Students write their own HTML page with headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

## ⏱️ Sample Timing for 1-Hour Session

| Time      | Activity                                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 0:00–0:10 | Warm-up + review of Git                                   |
| 0:10–0:25 | Explore: how the web works + HTML basics                  |
| 0:25–0:50 | Apply: students build their first web page                |
| 0:50–1:00 | Wrap-up: share student pages + questions                  |

## ❓ Check for Understanding (Ask 2–3)

- What role does the browser play in displaying a webpage?  
- What’s the difference between the `<head>` and `<body>` of an HTML file?  
- How does an `<a>` tag work?  

## 🧑‍🏫 Explore Prompts

Show a minimal HTML file and explain each part:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my very first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Walk through:
- Why we need `<!DOCTYPE html>`  
- The `<head>` vs. `<body>`  
- What a heading (`<h1>`) and paragraph (`<p>`) do  

## 🛠️ Apply Prompts (Live Coding & Troubleshooting)

### 🔧 Common Sticking Points
* Forgetting to close tags (e.g., `<p>` without `</p>`)  
* Placing visible content inside `<head>` instead of `<body>`  
* Incorrect file extension (`.txt` instead of `.html`)  
* Expecting a browser to show images without the correct file path  

### ✅ Try This Live

**Prompt:**  
Create an HTML file that includes:  
- A heading with your name  
- A paragraph introducing yourself  
- A link to your favorite website  
- An image (can be from the web or local)  

## 💬 Engagement Strategies (for quiet groups)

- **Website Show & Tell:** Students share a favorite site and you discuss how HTML might be behind it.  
- **Spot the Error:** Show an HTML file with missing tags and have students fix it.  
- **Browser Magic:** Save an HTML file and refresh the browser to demonstrate instant updates.  

## 💡 Optional Challenges

- Create an ordered list (`<ol>`) of your top 3 foods or hobbies.  
- Add multiple headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) to create a document outline.  
- Add an `<img>` tag with a width/height attribute to resize the image.  

✅ **Mentor To-Do**  
- [ ] Run a session using this guide.  
- [ ] Make sure each student successfully opens their `.html` file in a browser.  
- [ ] Submit your [Mentor Session Report](https://airtable.com/appoSRJMlXH9KvE6w/shrp0jjRtoMyTXRzh).

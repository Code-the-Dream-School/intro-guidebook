## Explore Lesson 05: Intro to Git and IDEs

**Weekly Learning objective**

Students will be able to explain the purpose and benefits of version control systems like Git, create and manage repositories to track file changes over time, and utilize GitHub to back up and maintain version history; optionally, students may begin developing algorithms as step-by-step instructions to solve problems.

  * [Coding assignment rubric]() (TBD)

## Lesson Plan

### Entrance ticket (~5 minutes)
**Display the first slide:**
  * Prompt for Discussion:
    * "Can you think of tools or apps you've used that save or track different versions of your work? For example, Google Docs lets you see revision history. What others come to mind?"
  * Possible Examples to Discuss:
    * Google Docs (revision history).
    * Dropbox/OneDrive/Google Drive (file backups).
    * Gaming platforms (save files or checkpoints).
    * Code editors with undo/redo functionality.
  * Facilitation Tips:
    * If students are unsure, offer examples to prompt their thinking.
    * Keep the discussion light and interactive; this is a warm-up to engage them.
   
  **Display the second slide to show the learning objective.**

### Part 1: Mentor-led instruction (~15 minutes)

**Use slides 3-9 for mentor-led instruction.**

#### IDEs

  * Overivew of IDEs
      * Enter programming text with formatting assistance.
      * Aspects of IDEs
          * Versioning system
          * Interactive windows
          * Debugger
          * Coding hints
  * Note that CTD recommends VS Code if students do not already have a preference.

#### Intro to Git

  * Command line
  * Setting up Git
  * Versioning systems
  * History and features of GitHub
  * Git toolkbox
  * Pull requests

### Part 2: Guided practice (~15 minutes)

**Stop sharing slide deck and open VS code.**

  * Ask students to open VS Code and follow along with you.
  * Guide students through the following steps. Make sure to go slowly to allow students time to follow along. Pause for questions if appropriate.
    * Creating a new folder for a project.
    * Initializing a repository.
    * Making and staging changes.
    * Writing a commit message.

### Part 3: Small group practice (~15 minutes)

**Share screen with the small group practice instructions slide.**

  * Give students the following instructions:
      * "We're now going to practice making and editing a new file, add a file to a GitHub repository, and adding additional commits. Follow these steps to successfully complete the task:"
          * Create a new GitHub repository named `intro-to-git-[your-name]` (e.g., intro-to-git-Jazmine).
          * Initialize the repository locally and connect it to your GitHub account.
          * Create a file named notes.txt with a summary of what you’ve learned so far about repositories and commits.
          * Commit the changes and push them to the GitHub repository.
  * Tell studnets they will have about 10 minutes in breakout rooms to complete the task. 
   
**Use the breakout room feature to put students into small groups (around 3-5 students — whatever feels right depending on mentor session attendance and student engagement).**
  * As students are in breakout rooms, feel free to cycle through the rooms to check in on students and answer questions. After about 10 minutes, bring students back to the main call.
  * When entering a room, ask something like, "How’s it going? Any questions or roadblocks so far?"

  * Ask, "What was one challenge you encountered in your small group? How were you able to overcome it?"
      * For shy or quiet groups, suggest using targeted questions (e.g., “What’s one thing that stood out to you about versioning systems?”).
      * For highly engaged groups, mentors could encourage deeper discussion or additional practice.
  * Finish the discussion by celebrating students' hard work. 

### Exit Ticket (~5 minutes)

**Display the final slide.**

  * "Learning Git can be intimidating at first! Let me know how you're feeling right now. You have two options to participate:
      * React with a Zoom emoji that displays how you're feeling right now!
      * Post a question about Git in the chat"
  * Comment on student responses and answer questions as appropriate to end the session on a positive, engaging note.

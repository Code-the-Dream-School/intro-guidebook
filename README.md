## Overview

## Sample Mentor Session 

### :wave: Check-In

#### Check-In Open-Ended Questions 

- Start with an icebreaker from this [icebreaker list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WbwKn8B5GfRueq7Zbw0zx_k15aqyIqIs23i_WHI-pPI/edit?usp=sharing). 
- What is something that you are excited to learn more about this week? 

#### Check-In Progress Poll 

- What is your progress on **this week's** materials?

  - [ ] Done
  - [ ] Almost Done
  - [ ] Halfway

Let's take a look at the directions for this week's assignment: [XXX](XXX)

### :thinking: Questions 

Use this time to answer students questions from the lesson materials and assignments. Rememember to incorporate teaching strategies: 

  - **Think aloud**: Narrate your thinking to show students how developers approach problems. For example, “When I saw this problem, I decided to approach it by…”
  - Use **positive narration**. For example, “I appreciate that Raheem has his camera on today” or “That was an excellent question."
  - **Warm call** on students or **practice popcorn calling** (students can ask another student for help) if participation is low.
  - Incorporate 10 seconds of **wait time** when you're expecting students to respond to you. This is how long it takes the average person to formulate their answer to your question or think of a question of their own.

### :notebook: Assignment Overview

TBD

### :thinking: Questions 

Use this time to answer students questions from the lesson materials and assignments. Rememember to incorporate teaching strategies: 

  - **Think aloud**: Narrate your thinking to show students how developers approach problems. For example, “When I saw this problem, I decided to approach it by…”
  - Use **positive narration**. For example, “I appreciate that Raheem has his camera on today” or “That was an excellent question."
  - **Warm call** on students or **practice popcorn calling** (students can ask another student for help) if participation is low.
  - Incorporate 10 seconds of **wait time** when you're expecting students to respond to you. This is how long it takes the average person to formulate their answer to your question or think of a question of their own.
